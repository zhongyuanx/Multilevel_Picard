# Multilevel_Picard

The main goals of these pieces of codes are to implement an exact simulation version of the multi-level Picard scheme for the test problems in Section 7 of the paper, the least-control policy, and a version of the multi-level Picard scheme using Euler scheme. 

Problem parameters are contained in "PSS_Ex.jl."
